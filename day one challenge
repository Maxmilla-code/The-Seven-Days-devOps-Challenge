DevOps Learning Journey 🚀
Day 1: AWS & EC2 Fundamentals
This repository documents my DevOps learning journey. This is Day One of my DevOps challenge, focused on setting up the foundational cloud environment required for future CI/CD work.
The learning and steps followed here are based on the 7-Day DevOps Challenge (Day 1) video by Natasha from the Nexar team.

What I Learned
On Day 1, the goal was simple and critical: create a secure AWS environment and launch an EC2 instance that I can interact with from my local machine using VS Code.
This sets the foundation for building, deploying, and automating applications in the cloud.

Steps Completed
1. Created an AWS Account
•	Signed up for an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.
•	Logged in initially as the root user.
AWS Console: https://aws.amazon.com/console/
________________________________________
2. Created an IAM User (Best Practice)
•	Created a new IAM user instead of using the root account.
•	Assigned AdministratorAccess permissions.
•	Enabled AWS Management Console access for the user.
•	Downloaded and stored the IAM credentials securely.
IAM Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/
Why this matters: Using an IAM user improves security and protects the root account from everyday usage.

3. Launched an EC2 Instance
•	Navigated to the EC2 dashboard.
•	Launched a Free Tier eligible EC2 instance.
•	Selected a Linux-based AMI.
•	Used instance type: t2.micro.
EC2 Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/
What an EC2 instance is: An EC2 instance is a virtual computer in the cloud that runs applications and stores code.

4. Created and Configured a Key Pair
•	Created a new EC2 key pair.
•	Downloaded the .pem private key file.
•	Updated file permissions to allow secure access.
•	Stored the key safely for future SSH connections.
Key pair documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html
________________________________________
5. Configured Network & Security Settings
•	Allowed SSH traffic only from my IP address.
•	Avoided opening SSH access to the public internet.
What SSH is: SSH (Secure Shell) allows secure remote access to servers like EC2 instances.

________________________________________
6. Connected EC2 to VS Code
•	Installed VS Code locally.
•	Used the SSH key to connect VS Code to the EC2 instance.
•	Enabled direct interaction with the cloud server from my editor.
VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
VS Code Remote SSH Extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh
________________________________________
Outcome
By the end of Day 1, I successfully:
•	Set up a secure AWS environment
•	Launched and configured an EC2 instance
•	Connected my EC2 instance to VS Code using SSH
This environment will be used throughout the DevOps challenge to build, deploy, and automate applications.

Next Steps
Day 2 will focus on deploying a simple web application and preparing the environment for CI/CD automation.
